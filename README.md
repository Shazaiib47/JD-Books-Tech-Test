# JD-Bookstore Tech Test

## Introduction to Task

The JD Bookstore is a webpage created using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to list a variety of books through the Google Books API URL.
The webpage is completely responsive and has JavaScript functionality to ensure the listing page has been met through the requirements.

## Requirements met

1) Each book in the list displays book cover, title, subtitle, authors, number of pages and description

2) Able to select on a book anywhere on the page by clicking on it.
    - Made clear through the use of user clicking on it and a selection is made via is-selected class

3) Able to click on the selected book a second time to remove the class

4) Reloading the page remembers the state of selected books
    - This currently has limited functionality and does not perform as expected

5) Book description has a max character limit of 140 characters.
